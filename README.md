# CSS3: The Interesting Bits

### A repo to hold all the files for my workshop "CSS3: The Interesting Bits", held on January 26, 2017.  

The workshop focuses on creating 2 CSS-only snippets from scratch: An elegant navigation bar, and a cool login page.  
Both snippets are coded collectively with the attendees during the Workshop.  

#### So how do I prepare for the workshop?  
- Have a working laptop
- Get a fancy text editor (I personally use Atom)
- That's pretty much it!
