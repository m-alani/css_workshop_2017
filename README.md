# CSS3: The Interesting Bits

### A repository to hold all the files for the workshop "CSS3: The Interesting Bits", held on January 26, 2017 @ York University  

The workshop focuses on creating 2 CSS-only snippets from scratch: An elegant navigation bar, and a cool login page.  
Both snippets are coded interactively with the attendees during the Workshop.  
The goal of the workshop is to get everyone a bit more comfortable with CSS, and to push the attendees limits beyond the simple basics.  

#### So how do I prepare for the workshop?  
- Have a working laptop
- Get a fancy text editor (I personally use Atom)
- That's pretty much it!

Special thanks goes to York University and CS Hub for hosting this workshop.
